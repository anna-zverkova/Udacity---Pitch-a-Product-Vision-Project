# Udacity---Pitch-a-Product-Vision-Project
Udacity - Product Manager - Pitch a Product Vision Project - Kaiser Permanente. Project Notes.

### Selected scenario: Option 1 - Kaiser Permanente a mobile application that communicates with KP patients and helps them improve on healthy habits.

#### Project brief: 
Kaiser Permanente is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes.
Your team is tasked with researching the potential costs, features and benefits of a mobile application that communicates with KP patients and helps them improve on healthy habits.

#### Quick research 

Do quick research into the company (20 to 30 minutes) on each of these:
1.) Google the company and the market

Kaiser Permanente is a privately held, notfor-profit organization. 
Principal Subsidiary Companies: Kaiser Permanente is an organization of three business segments that are linked by exclusive contracts: 
- Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, Inc.; 
- Kaiser Foundation Hospitals; and 
- Permanente Medical Groups.

##### About: 
Kaiser Permanente is one of the nation’s largest not-for-profit health plans, serving 12.6 million members. 
At Kaiser Permanente, physicians are responsible for medical decisions. 
The Permanente Medical Groups, which provide care for Kaiser Permanente members, continuously develop and refine medical practices to help ensure 
that care is delivered in the most efficient and effective manner possible.

Below info is taken from Wiki, so will need further verifying if I decide to cite this info in my presentation. 

Kaiser Permanente, commonly known simply as Kaiser, is an American integrated managed care consortium, based in Oakland, California, United States.

Founded in 1945 by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser and physician Sidney Garfield. 


It operates 39 hospitals and more than 700 medical offices, with over 300,000 personnel, including more than 87,000 physicians and nurses.

KP's quality of care has been highly rated and attributed to an emphasis on preventive care, 
its doctors being salaried rather than paid on a fee-for-service basis, and an attempt to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals 
by carefully planning their stay. 


The need for telehealth and remote care remained high throughout 2021, and Kaiser Permanente focused on more than just meeting the need: 
We worked on ways to enhance care while providing increased safety and convenience for our members.

Over the course of the year, we provided more than 9.4 million video visits and 
15.8 million e-visits — that’s more than 3 times as many as in 2020. 
We enabled our members to sign in to the kp.org member website and mobile app nearly 692 million times to take actions like sending secure messages 
to clinicians, viewing lab results, and submitting 51 million prescriptions to be filled online. 
All these interactions are integrated into our electronic health record system.

Our portfolio of digital self-care apps — to help members improve their well-being and mindfulness and enhance their sleep or mood — 
continue to be highly valued by our 700,000 registered members.

In 2021, we set out to make 24/7 virtual care available to members with the launch of Get Care Now on kp.org. 
It provides another personalized way for our members to talk with a clinician and get convenient, high-quality care. 
During each phone or video visit, a Kaiser Permanente clinician can access the member’s electronic health record and use the medical history 
to help inform care decisions, order prescriptions, schedule follow-up procedures, or make a referral to a specialist.

We are expanding access to high-quality care and convenience, while preserving the patient-centered care experiences our members expect — all 
within our connected, integrated system.

2.) Do some searches on competitors you might already know about or terms like “competitors”, “Total Addressable Market” or “revenue” related to this market. - Get to know the material and the market.

Total Addressable Marke: Digital Health Market is Estimated to be Worth US$ 224.24 Bn in 2022 and is Likely to Grow at a CAGR of 27.7%.

How big is the US telehealth market?

According to Nova one advisor, the U.S. Telehealth market size was valued at US$ 23.8 billion in 2021 and is expected to hit US$ 309.9 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.1% from 2022 to 2030.


What diseases are preventable by lifestyle?

Several lines of evidence indicate that realistic modifications of diet and lifestyle can prevent most 
- CAD, 
- stroke, 
- diabetes, 
- colon cancer, and 
- smoking-related cancers.

Plus there are diseases preventable by vaccines!!!


In 2021, the company had a total of 12.6 million members. 

Total operating revenues for 2021 were $93.1 billion compared to $88.7 billion in 2020. Total operating expenses were $92.5 billion.


#### Instructions:

Your goal will be to research this opportunity, create a pitch deck for the product you hope to build, and then present it.

Make a copy of this Google doc Starter Template or download the PPT template from the resource section of this project. Complete each section to create a pitch deck for the product you hope to build.

### Your project will be evaluated on the following dimensions:

#### Credibility: 
Does the presentation sound credible? Here’s where your research will come in handy. Are you backing up your assertions and statements of facts with citations and links? Does the opportunity you describe sound approachable? Many students will make the mistake of aiming too high “we aim to replace Facebook." This is simply not credible in a pitch deck. A more credible statement might be “we aim to become the social network for politically active millennials”.

The same applies to business cases. If your business case is too detailed it starts becoming brittle. A brittle business case is one that’s based on too many assumptions. It’s the epitome of “too many if’s”. For example “If we assume that 20% of millennials are interested in advocacy and if out of that 20 %, 10% are unsatisfied in Facebook and if we can get them to log in 3 times a week and if we assume they click on an ad once out of three visits and if we assume each ad generates \$1 then our return on investment is…” This business case is brittle. If any of these assumptions are wrong then it falls apart. Even worse, if your stakeholder audience gets lost in all these assumptions, you will lose their attention. Consider the following instead: “Facebook currently generates \$55B a year from 2.4B active users. If we can draw in 1% of that audience (24 million users, which is less than 5% of the available millennial audience), that would represent 55 million a year in revenue at a monetization rate 10 times worse than Facebook’s.”

Notice that difference here. You’re using clear and publicly available numbers and you’re being conservative. You’re saying that if you manage to draw in just 5% of millennials at a very poor monetization rate, you’ll still be making $55 million a year. It’s easy to follow and simple to understand.

#### Delivery: 
Yes, even the best products live or die by the delivery of their pitch. A product might be incredible but if the product manager’s delivery is poor, no one will invest in it. At the same time, bad products can get investment with good pitches. If you’re thinking to yourself “how the heck did things like Sharknado 4, Juicero, Microsoft Bob and the watermelon oreo (yes, that was a thing) ever get funded?” It's because some product managers out there made a heck of a pitch presentation. For your delivery, remember two things. Look knowledgeable and look positive.
Looking knowledgeable means knowing your material. If it seems like you’re just reading off bullet points from a slide, your audience will assume you’re not knowledgeable. The bullet points are there to summarize what you’re going to say, not provide a script.

Looking positive means sounding like you believe in this product. You need to be the cheerleader of your product because no one else will. When you talk about your product you should sound positive, excited and happy. This is based on product management and it’s the key to getting your ideas approved as opposed to always working on someone else’s ideas.
